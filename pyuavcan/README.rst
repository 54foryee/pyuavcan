PyUAVCAN
========

PyUAVCAN is a full-featured implementation of the `UAVCAN protocol stack <https://uavcan.org>`_ in Python.
PyUAVCAN aims to support all features and transport layers of UAVCAN,
be portable across all major platforms supporting Python, and
be extensible to permit low-effort experimentation and testing of new protocol capabilities.

If you have questions, please bring them to the `UAVCAN support forum <https://forum.uavcan.org/>`_.

Installation
------------

Install from PIP: ``pip install pyuavcan``.

Note that a similar library titled ``uavcan`` is also available from PIP,
which implements an early experimental version of the protocol known as UAVCAN v0
that is no longer recommended for new designs.
It should not be confused with this library (titled ``pyuavcan``, mind the difference)
which implements the long-term stable version of the protocol known as UAVCAN v1.0.
